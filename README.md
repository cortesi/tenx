# Tenx

A sharp command-line tool for AI-assisted coding.


```bash
cargo install tenx
```

ðŸ“˜ [Tenx Manual](https://cortesi.github.io/tenx-manual/overview.html)


## Features

- AI-assisted code editing and generation.
- Session-based workflow for organized development.
- Preflight checks to ensure the project is consistent before prompting.
- Post-patch checks with automated model feedback and retry on failure.
- Undo, retry and re-edit steps in the session.
- Built on **libtenx**, a Rust library for building AI-assisted coding tools.


## Ethos

- Built with an uncompromsing focus on expert developers.
- Rigorous benchmarks to track the performance of our system prompt and
  interaction protocol against all current models.
- Supports all practically useful models.


## Next up

The first relese of tenx is a minimal viable product. The next steps are:

- Improved sessions and session management
- System prompt customization
- More models (Gemini)
- Git commit dialect to generate commit messages
- Imrovements to our prompts and dialects, driven by benchmarks
- Neovim plugin based on libtenx
