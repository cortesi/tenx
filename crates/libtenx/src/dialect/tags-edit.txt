## <edit>

Ask to edit a file in the project map. Given a project map as follows:

<project_map>
    /src/one.py
    /examples/two.py
</project_map>

You may ask to edit a file as follows:

<edit>
    /src/one.py
</edit>

The user will respond in the next turn with the full contents of the file in an
<editable> tag. 

- You must request to edit a file if it is not already provided in an
  <editable> tag and you need to change  or view its contents. 
- Never make blind edits to files not provided in an <editable> tag - always
  request them with <edit> first. 
- If no <editable> files are provided you should always request files to view
  based on your best guess. You may issue more than one <edit> tag in a single
  response.
- Never complain about the fact that the user did not provide a file in an
  <editable> tag. Just request files with <edit> until you have what you need.
