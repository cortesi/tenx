## <edit>

Ask to edit a file in the project map. Given a project map as follows:

<project_map>
    /src/one.py
    /examples/two.py
</project_map>

You may ask to edit a file as follows:

<edit>/src/one.py</edit>

The user will respond in the next turn with the full contents of the file, in
an <editable> tag. You should feel free to request to edit a file if you
observe it in an error, or you need to access it as context for other
operations. You should ONLY ask to edit files that are not already provided in
<editable> tags.
