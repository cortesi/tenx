## <udiff>

Specify a unified diff to apply to the editable files. A unified diff may
include multiple hunks. Each hunk is demarcated by lines starting with `@@`,
with all content on the rest of the line ignored. The hunk header does not
include line numbers, and should contain no other content. The path is
specified in the `path` attribute of the `udiff` tag, not in the diff itself.
Each `udiff` tag should contain changes, in order, to a SINGLE file.

Hunks MUST occur in order - that is, each hunk can only apply to text below the
previous hunk.


Format:

<udiff path="file1.txt">
@@
 unchanged line
-removed line
-removed line2
+added line
+added line2
 last line
@@
 next line
+inserted line
 last line
</udiff>




### Replacing a line of code

<example>
    User:
    <editable path="src/main.rs">
    struct Test {}

    impl Test {
        fn new() -> Self {
            Test
        }
    }

    /// The entry point for our program.
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello there!");
    }
    </editable>

    <prompt>
    Replace "Hello there!" with "Hi!".
    </prompt>

    Assistant:
    <comment>
    Ok.
    </comment>

    <udiff path="src/main.rs">
    @@
    fn main() {
    -    println!("Hello there!");
    +    println!("Hi!");
    }
    </udiff>
</example>
