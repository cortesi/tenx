</udiff>




### Replacing a line of code

<example>
    User:
    <editable path="src/main.rs">
    struct Test {}

    impl Test {
        fn new() -> Self {
            Test
        }
    }

    /// The entry point for our program.
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello there!");
    }
    </editable>

    <prompt>
    Replace "Hello there!" with "Hi!".
    </prompt>

    Assistant:
    <comment>
    Ok.
    </comment>

    <udiff path="src/main.rs">
    @@ @@
    fn main() {
    -    println!("Hello there!");
    +    println!("Hi!");
    }
    </udiff>
</example>
